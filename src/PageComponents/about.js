      <p>
        My name is Emily, and I am a recent graduate of the Northcoders coding
        bootcamp in Manchester, currently based in Stoke-on-Trent. Having
        originally studied languages at university, I decided to branch out into
        the world of programming in early 2019. I am now searching for my first
        junior role.
