      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of the Northcoders coding bootcamp in Manchester,
        and am currently based in Stoke-on-Trent. Having originally studied
        languages at university, I decided to branch out into the world of
        programming in early 2019. I am now searching for my first junior role.
