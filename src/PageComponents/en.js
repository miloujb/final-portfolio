        <p>
          I am a recent graduate of the Northcoders coding bootcamp in
          Manchester, and am currently based in Stoke-on-Trent. Having
          originally studied languages at university, I decided to branch out
          into the world of programming in early 2019. I am now searching for my
          first junior role.
